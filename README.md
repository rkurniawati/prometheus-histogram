# Example Spring Boot app that publishes Prometheus histogram and summary metrics

This is an example Spring Boot application that demonstrates how you can create and publish Prometheus histogram and 
summary metrics using the Micrometer library. More information can be found in this article.

## Requirements

To run this sample, you will need to have the following software installed on your machine:
- Java (17 or later)
- Maven (3.8.3 or later) or Gradle (7.2 or later)
- Docker (20.10.8 or later)

## Running the Application

To run the application and start the Prometheus and Grafana containers, use the following command:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Or, if you prefer to use Gradle, you can use the following command:

```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```

## Querying Metrics

To see the metrics exposed by the application along with their values, you can use the following command (or simply open the URL in a browser):

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/prometheus
```

## Querying Metrics Using Prometheus

You can use Prometheus UI to query the metrics using PromQL. This UI can be accessed at the following endpoint:
    
```
http://localhost:9090/
```

## Viewing Metrics in Grafana

To view the metrics in Grafana, you can access Grafana using the following URL and navigate to the `Dashboard` section:

```
http://localhost:3000/
```

## Changing the Average Response Time and Request Count

To change the average response time and request count, you can use the following REST endpoints:
- http://localhost:8080/setResponseTimeMeanSeconds
- http://localhost:8080/setMeanNumberOfVisits

For example, to set the average response time to 700 ms, you can use the following command:

```bash
curl -v -X POST http://localhost:8080/setMeanResponseTimeSeconds -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d 0.7
```

To set the mean number of visits to 5, you can use the following command:

```bash
curl -v -X POST http://localhost:8080/setMeanNumberOfVisits -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d 5
```
